# Prerequisites
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```
# 5 Data transformation
#5.6 Grouped summaries with summarise()
```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

```
# 5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe
```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")

# It looks like delays increase with distance up to ~750 miles 
# and then decrease. Maybe as flights get longer there's more 
# ability to make up delays in the air?
ggplot(data = delay, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

```
# 5.6.2 Missing values
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
# In this case, where missing values represent cancelled flights, we could also tackle the problem by first removing the cancelled flights. We’ll save this dataset so we can reuse in the next few examples.
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```
# 5.6.3 Counts
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)
## scatter plot
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
## depending on group size?
delays %>% 
  filter(n > 25) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```
# 5.6.4 Useful summary functions
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
    avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
  )
## Measures of spread
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))
## Measures of rank
# When do the first and last flights leave each day?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first = min(dep_time),
    last = max(dep_time)
  )
## Measures of position
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first_dep = first(dep_time), 
    last_dep = last(dep_time)
  )
## These functions are complementary to filtering on ranks. Filtering gives you all variables, with each observation in a separate row
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  mutate(r = min_rank(desc(dep_time))) %>% 
  filter(r %in% range(r))
## counts
### Which destinations have the most carriers?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(carriers))
### Counts are so useful that dplyr provides a simple helper if all you want is a count:
not_cancelled %>% count(dest)
### You can optionally provide a weight variable. For example, you could use this to “count” (sum) the total number of miles a plane flew:
not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)
### Counts and proportions of logical values: sum(x > 10), mean(y == 0). When used with numeric functions, TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE to 0. This makes sum() and mean() very useful: sum(x) gives the number of TRUEs in x, and mean(x) gives the proportion.
#### How many flights left before 5am? (these usually indicate delayed
#### flights from the previous day)
not_cancelled %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))
#### What proportion of flights are delayed by more than an hour?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))
```
# 5.6.5 Grouping by multiple variables
```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
(per_day   <- summarise(daily, flights = n()))
(per_month <- summarise(per_day, flights = sum(flights)))
(per_year  <- summarise(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```
# 5.6.6 Ungrouping
```{r}
daily %>% 
  ungroup() %>%             # no longer grouped by date
  summarise(flights = n())  # all flights
```

# 5.6.7 Exercises
```{r}
#1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
## A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
## A flight is always 10 minutes late.
## A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
## 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.

#2. Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?

#3. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

#4. Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

#5. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

#6. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))

#7. What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?
